Project Name : Optimization Model-Code optimization in compiler design

Code Optimization in Compiler Design improves the performance and efficiency of compiled code without changing its output.

Types of Optimization: Machine-Independent Optimization: ✅ Constant folding (e.g., 2 + 3 → 5) ✅ Common subexpression elimination ✅ Dead code elimination (removing unused code) ✅ Loop unrolling and invariant code motion

Machine-Dependent Optimization: ✅ Register allocation ✅ Instruction scheduling ✅ Peephole optimization (removing redundant instructions)

Phases in Compilation: Frontend: Lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis Intermediate Code: Optimization at the intermediate representation (IR) level Backend: Machine-specific optimization and code generation Goal: ✅ Reduce execution time ✅ Minimize memory usage ✅ Improve power efficiency2
